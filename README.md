# plaza-screen
This project is to display a list of "This Week's Events on City Hall Plaza" on the newly-installed e-ink screen on the plaza. For the time being, it uses Github Pages to serve the page, which [is available here]( http://monum.github.io/plaza-screen).

This was developed as proof-of-concept prototype by MONUM Summer Fellows, Yusuf Dahl and Karti Subramanian in the Summer of 2016. Their transition memo [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/a/boston.gov/document/d/1g6Y-wRAFzugEaTKnVsCE3PJqclD7NalfAv-xAxkNLso/edit?usp=sharing).
